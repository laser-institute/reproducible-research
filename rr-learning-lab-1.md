# Getting Started With git and GitHub

## Introduction
[GitHub](http://github.com/) is a web-based tool for sharing your R code with others and for collaborating with others on R code. It is very powerful but also can be challenging to use. 

This learning lab is organized around two tasks:

1. Exporting one of your projects from RStudio Cloud
2. Adding the exported project to your GitHub account

If you complete the first of these two tasks, that is still a success, as it means that you can access and use all of the code you wrote (and work you did) even more easily by having it on your desktop.

Let's begin with the first of these two tasks.

## Task #1: Exporting one of your projects from RStudio Cloud

This short screencast walks through exporting a project from RStudio Cloud: https://www.screencast.com/t/XUdPZmi9CQ

## Task #2: Adding the exported project to your GitHub account

There are a number of steps you must first take to add your exported project to your GitHub account. These are as follow, with links to instructions from the excellent book[*Happy git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/) on how to complete them:

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) 
2. [Install git (or confirm that you have it already installed - you very well may even if you haven't used git before!)](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
3. [Introduce yourself to git (install the {usethis} package and follow the instructions at this link for how to use it)](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)
4. [Connect to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html)
5. [Cache credentials for HTTPS](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)
6. [Connect RStudio to git and GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
7. [Push a project from your RStudio Desktop application to GitHub using the {usethis} package](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html)
